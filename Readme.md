# jQuery During Scroll

A script to execute arbitrary code when a user starts to scroll, during the scroll and after a scroll has completed. This is different from the default browser and jQuery behavior in that it treats the entire scroll action as one long event instead of executing hundreds of times during a single scroll action.

## Installation

While the plugin is titled as though it's just a jQuery plugin, it is available in many formats.
